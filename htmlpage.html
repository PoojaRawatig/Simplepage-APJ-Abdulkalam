                <b>All about the APJ Abdul Kalam experience with Swami Sivananda,<b> which was referred to in his autobiography and book Wings Of Fire “I narrated the incident which took place way back in 1957. I was ranked ninth in the Air force Selection results. But only eight candidates were commissioned. I knew that the days ahead would be difficult. I left Deharadun and reached Rishikesh on my way to Delhi. I took bath in the holy river Ganga and walked to Sivananda Ashram, which is situated a little away up the hill. I met Swami Sivananda – a man who looked like Buddha. I was struck by his irresistible child-like smile and gracious manner.”
